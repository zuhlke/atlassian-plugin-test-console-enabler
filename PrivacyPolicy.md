# Privacy Policy
The Plugin Test Console Enabler receives and stores no data whatsoever.

You are strongly discouraged from installing this plugin in any publicly accessible JIRA server, as it is intended
solely to help you run the "wired" tests you write while developing your own plugin.
This is why there is only a Server edition of the plugin.
