# End User Licence Agreement (EULA)
This document is based on the former Atlassian "Standard EULA", with thanks and acknowledgements.

This End User Licence Agreement (this "__Agreement__") between __you__ and Zuhlke Engineering Ltd ("__Zuhlke__")
covers your use of the Zuhlke-supplied Atlassian Marketplace Product (the "__Software__") to which it applies.

This Agreement does not have to be signed in order to be binding. You indicate your assent to the terms of this
Agreement by using the Software.

1. Zuhlke is the licensor of the Software and Atlassian is not a party to this EULA.

1. Zuhlke grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable licence to download
and use the Software only on hardware systems owned, leased or controlled by you.

1. Licences granted by Zuhlke are granted subject to the condition that you must ensure the maximum number of
Authorized Users that are able to access and use the Software concurrently is equal to the number of User
Licences for which the necessary fees have been paid to Atlassian and/or its authorized partners (each, an
"__Atlassian Expert__"). You may purchase additional User Licences at any time on payment of the appropriate fees
to Atlassian or an Atlassian Expert. "__User Licence__" means a licence granted under this EULA to you to permit an
Authorized User to use the Software. The number of User Licences granted to you is dependent on the fees
paid by you. "__Authorized User__" means a person who accesses and uses the Software under the EULA and for
which the necessary fees have been paid to Atlassian and/or an Atlassian Expert.

1. Any information that Zuhlke collects from you or your device will be subject to a Zuhlke EULA, privacy notice,
or similar terms that Zuhlke provides to you, and will not be subject to the Atlassian Privacy Policy.

1. You may not modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software in whole or in part, or
create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in the Software, unless otherwise expressly
authorized in writing by Zuhlke. However, if the Software includes an Open Source License, you have all
the rights regarding the Software conferred by the same Open Source License.

1. The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Unless otherwise
expressly stated in the Zuhlke EULA, Zuhlke or its licensors own all title, copyright and other intellectual property
rights in the Software, and the Software is licensed to you directly by Zuhlke, not sold.
