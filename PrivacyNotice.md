# Privacy Notice
The Plugin Test Console Enabler receives and stores no data whatsoever.
 
It is intended solely to help you run the "wired" tests you write while
developing your own plugin.
This is why there is only a Server edition of the plugin.

You MUST NOT instal this plugin in any production or publicly
accessible server.
While I am not aware of any security vulnerabilities in this plugin,
I cannot guarantee that there are none.
